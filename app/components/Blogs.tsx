              But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing
              pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete
              account of the system and expound the actual teachings of the
              great explorer of the truth, the master- builder of human
              happiness. No one rejects, dislike, or avoids plasure itself,
              because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to
              pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are
              extremly painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues.
